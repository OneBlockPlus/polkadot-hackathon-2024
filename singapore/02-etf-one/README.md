![](./doc/etf-logo.jpg)
## Introduction

Enhanced Token Fortress (ETF.com) is a zero-trust Web3 asset management platform.

Is your teamâ€™s asset management centralized and controlled by a single person? As a key leader, are you stuck doing accounting tasks daily, even for small reimbursements? Do you feel unsafe about entrusting new staff with a multi-sig key?


ETF addresses these issues by leveraging the power of cryptographic algorithms to create a zero-trust environment:

* Depositing cryptocurrencies is not required or necessary.
* Run your Web3 business by inviting staff, accountants, and operators into your team without the need for trust.

## Features planned for the Hackathon
- [x] Authentication & Authorization
- [x] Multi-tenancy support
- [x] Polkadot Integration
- [x] Ethereum Integration
- [x] Wallet&Team Integration
- [x] Transaction workflow Management
- [x] zero-trust applied to asset management

## Architect
A typical blockchain transaction has three major steps:
* Txn Creation
* Txn Signing
* Miner Confirm Txn & Signature 

In Asymmetric Cryptography, the private key is used to sign the transaction, and the public key is used to verify the signature. Hence we can see Txn Creation doesn't require neither of them, so we can separate the Txn Creation from the Txn Signing.
