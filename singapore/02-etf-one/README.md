## Introduction

Enhanced Token Fortress (ETF.com) is a zero-trust Web3 asset management platform.

Is your teamâ€™s asset management centralized and controlled by one person? As a key leader, are you stuck handling accounting tasks daily, even for minor reimbursements? Do you feel unsafe about entrusting a new staff member with a multi-sig key?


ETF addresses these issues by leveraging the power of cryptographic algorithms to create a zero-trust environment:
* Depositing cryptocurrencies is not required or necessary.
* Run your Web3 business by inviting staff, accountants, and operators into your team without the need for trust.

## Architect
A transaction on blockchain has three major steps:

* Transaction creation
* Transaction signing
* Miner confirmation

In asymmetric cryptography, the private key is used to sign the transaction, and the public key is used to verify the signature. So transction creation doesn't require neither of them, `we can separate the transaction creation and signing process.
