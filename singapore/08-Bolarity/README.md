# Project Bolarity
## Introduction
Bolarity is an innovative blockchain platform built on the Substrate framework, distinguished by its support for interoperability between EVM and WASM contracts, allowing seamless interaction between different smart contract environments. This enables developers to build and deploy decentralized applications with greater flexibility, while benefiting from the advantages and convenience of different virtual machines.
## Features planned for the Hackathon
### - **Built on Substrate**

Bolarity is constructed using Substrate, a modular and flexible framework designed for creating customized blockchains. This foundation ensures that Bolarity benefits from Substrate's robust architecture, including its modularity, upgradability, and security features.

### - **BABE Consensus Protocol**

Bolarity utilizes the Blind Assignment for Blockchain Extension (BABE) as its consensus protocol. BABE is a well-known consensus mechanism used in Substrate-based chains that ensures the blockchain remains secure and efficient.

### - **Ethereum Compatibility via Frontier**

Through integration with the Frontier project, Bolarity is Ethereum-compatible, allowing users to deploy and interact with EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) smart contracts. This compatibility ensures that developers familiar with Ethereum can seamlessly migrate or develop new dApps on Bolarity.

### - **WASM Contract Support**

In addition to supporting EVM contracts, Bolarity also supports the deployment and execution of WASM (WebAssembly) smart contracts. This dual-contract environment offers developers the flexibility to choose the most suitable technology for their needs.

### - **Unified Ethereum Address Format**

Bolarity standardizes account management by using the Ethereum address format across the platform. Whether interacting with EVM or WASM contracts, users operate with a consistent address format, simplifying account management and interoperability.

### - **Interact with WASM Contracts via MetaMask**

Bolarity extends the capabilities of Ethereum-compatible wallets like MetaMask to interact not only with EVM contracts but also with WASM contracts. This feature enhances the user experience by allowing users to manage assets and execute transactions across different contract types using familiar tools.

### - **Interoperability between EVM and WASM Contracts**

With Bolarity, EVM and WASM contracts can call each other, enabling a highly interoperable contract environment. This unique capability opens up new possibilities for dApp development, allowing smart contracts to leverage the strengths of both virtual machines.
