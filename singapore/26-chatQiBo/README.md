# Project ChatQiBo
## Introduction
I want my custom GPT, named chatQiBo, to perform tasks related to personalized health and treatment advice based on traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). 
By analyzing the latest seasonal changes and current news, chatQiBo will provide users with customized wellness and treatment recommendations. 
The goal is for chatQiBo to help users maintain and improve their health by offering tailored advice that aligns with the principles of TCM, 
considering factors such as the 24 solar terms and real-time updates on health-related news and trends.
## Features planned for the Hackathon
1. Real-Time Seasonal Analysis: Implement a feature that dynamically adjusts health recommendations based on the current solar term, integrating traditional Chinese medical theory with modern meteorological data.
2. News Integration: Develop an automated system to parse and analyze current health news, using natural language processing to extract relevant information that influences TCM-based advice.
3. Customized Health Plans: Utilize user input regarding their physical condition and preferences to generate personalized wellness plans that include dietary advice, herbal remedies, and exercise suggestions according to TCM principles.
4. Interactive AI Consultation: Create a chatbot interface where users can ask health-related questions and receive instant, personalized responses based on TCM insights and real-time data analysis.
5. Community Feature: Build a platform for users to share their experiences and tips, fostering a community centered around holistic health and TCM practices.

## Architect

1. Polkadot Integration Layer:
Substrate Framework: Utilize Substrate, a blockchain-building framework from Polkadot, to develop and deploy chatQiBo's own blockchain tailored for health data security and interoperability.
Cross-Chain Messaging: Implement Polkadot’s cross-chain message passing (XCMP) to enable secure data sharing and interactions between chatQiBo and other healthcare or wellness blockchains within the Polkadot network.
2. Data Security and Compliance:
Decentralized Data Storage: Use Polkadot’s interoperable ecosystem to store health and wellness data across multiple blockchains, ensuring data security and compliance with global health data protection regulations.
On-chain Identity Verification: Leverage Polkadot’s identity management protocols to provide users with secure, verifiable on-chain identities, enhancing privacy and trust.
3. Enhanced User Features:
Token Economy: Develop a native token within chatQiBo’s blockchain for incentivizing community participation and facilitating transactions for health services and products.
Decentralized Application (DApp) Interface: Build a DApp on Polkadot to provide a decentralized platform for health services, including consultations, wellness program enrollments, and community interactions.
4. Scalability and Performance:
Parachains: Use Polkadot parachains for specific tasks within chatQiBo, such as real-time data analysis and processing, to enhance scalability and operational efficiency.
Inter-chain Bridges: Implement bridges between chatQiBo and other major health and wellness ecosystems to expand the network’s reach and functionality.
