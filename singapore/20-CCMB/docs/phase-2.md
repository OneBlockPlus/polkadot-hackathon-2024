### **Phase 2 - Core Development**

**Task Breakdown**:

1. **Implement the Core Message Passing Protocol**:

   - Design the core structure for message creation, relaying, and validation.
   - Develop functions for generating, signing, and validating cross-chain messages.

2. **Develop the Relayers**:

   - Implement relayers that handle the transfer of messages from the source chain to the destination chain.
   - Ensure that relayers maintain a secure, trustless environment.

3. **Develop the Validators**:

   - Implement validators that verify the integrity and validity of messages before they are executed on the destination chain.
   - Integrate cryptographic proofs for message validation.

4. **Create a Basic Message Hub**:

   - Develop a centralized or decentralized hub that routes messages between relayers and validators.
   - Ensure scalability and performance.

5. **Integrate with Polkadot Parachains**:
   - Develop the bridge's compatibility with Polkadot parachains, focusing on seamless integration.
