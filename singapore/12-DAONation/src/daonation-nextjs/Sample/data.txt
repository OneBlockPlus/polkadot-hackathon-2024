Engage with the Ugandan Jewish community (the Abayudaya), witness breathtaking natural wonders, do a game drive and river boat ride to see amazing wildlife and there’s an optional add-on to encounter mountain gorillas up close. We’ll be staying in the eastern part of Uganda, where you’ll make a real connection with our partner communities. You’ll visit Global Village Connect projects, schools and synagogues. You’ll hike beautiful Sipi Falls, and you’ll spend Shabbat with the Abayudaya community.
