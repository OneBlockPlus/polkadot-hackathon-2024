# Project Melody
## Introduction
Project Melody is a cutting-edge music NFT platform built on the Polkadot network. It aims to revolutionize the music industry by offering a decentralized platform where artists can tokenize their music, allowing for trading, distribution, and innovative ways to interact with their audiences.

## Background
The NFT market has seen explosive growth, with most NFTs being visual in nature, such as profile pictures (PFPs) or digital art. However, there is a noticeable gap in the market for audio NFTs, which have not been widely explored or developed. Traditional music distribution platforms wield significant control, often leaving artists with limited revenue streams and unclear rights management. Project Melody addresses these issues by providing a platform where music can be tokenized, creating a new revenue model for artists and ensuring transparent rights management.

## Features Planned for the Hackathon
1. Music Pallet Generation:

Basic methods for generating, authorizing, transferring, and destroying music NFTs, built on top of official unique-pallets.
Creation of collections and uploading of NFT metadata, with additional properties and external resources like IPFS links.

2. NFT Marketplace - Melody Pallet:

A platform for users to trade music NFTs, set prices, and conduct transactions directly.
Frontend integration to display bound images, allow music previews, and facilitate purchasing.
Future enhancements include personalized pages, collection views, and support for user-generated content and music promotion.

3. Metadata Management:

Support for decentralized storage solutions like IPFS and Crust.
Expansion into derivative works and music fragmentation, catering to different content formats like ringtones, intros, and more.

## Architect
The platform is built using Substrate, enabling multi-chain aggregation and offering a robust foundation for Web3 content ecosystems. The architecture supports various media types and allows for seamless integration across multiple platforms.

## Schedule
- Phase 1: Development of the Music Pallet and initial NFT marketplace.
- Phase 2: Frontend integration and user interface enhancements.
- Phase 3: Implementation of decentralized storage and metadata management.
- Phase 4: Expansion into multimedia NFTs and the creation of a DAO-driven community.

Project Melody aims to complete these phases over the course of the hackathon, with continuous updates and improvements planned post-hackathon to fully realize the platform's vision.
