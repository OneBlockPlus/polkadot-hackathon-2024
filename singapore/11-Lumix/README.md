# Lumix

## Introduction

Lumix is a system for event hosts and event attendees. Even hosts will create events and split their offerings/stock or whatever they will be selling at the event in to tokens/vouchers, and the attendies will buy those tokens/vouchers to be used at the event.

## Features planned for the Hackathon

The system consist of a Mobile App, a Website, an API, and a Smart Contract.

- Mobile App - Serves both hosts and attendees.
    1. Hosts will generate qrcode on the app for the attendees to scan and pay for what they are buying using the tokens/vouchers they have purchased on
    2. Attendees will use the app to buy tokens/voucher before an event, and to pay for goods at the event. Incase the tokens/vouchers still remain the attendee can reverse the remaining tokens.
