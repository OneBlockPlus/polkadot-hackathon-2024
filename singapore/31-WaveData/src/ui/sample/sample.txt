Study:
1. Sickle cell disease - quality of life

Sickle cell disease (SCD) has a significant effect on patient quality of life, with a global commonality in unmet treatment needs, disease burden, and effects on daily life, according to results from an international survey published in American Journal of Hematology.

2. Sickle cell disease - Parent-child relationship

Sickle cell disease is a group of conditions in which red blood cells are not shaped as they should be. Red blood cells normally look like round discs. But in sickle cell disease, they're shaped like sickles, or crescent moons, instead.

3. High blood pressure - Stress data

Exaggerated cardiovascular response to acute and chronic stresses increases the risk for hypertension and cardiovascular disease. Stress also can be broadly defined as a disruption of homeostasis

----------------------->Introduction<--------------------

-->https://youtu.be/xtSHFg47QgU


-->Dear {patient_name}, 

We would like to ask you to participate in a study about your sickle cell disease and how you feel about your health and about yourself. 

You can decide for yourself whether you want to participate. But your parents have to sign for you


-->Dear {patient_name},  

Would you like to take part in a study about your health and living with sickle cell disease? 
Before you say yes take some time to read about the research and your rights.
Read this carefully, because then you will know what you are deciding about. You can take your time before you decide. 

Your parents will also have to read this information with you, because they have to make a decision together with you.



-->Dear Sir/Madam,

Are you interested to take part in a study about the daily burden of living with Sickle cell disease? 

If you are interested, please go on reading the information about what kind of research it is, what it means for you, and what the advantages and disadvantages are. 

It's a lot of information, you can take your time to think about it.

If you decide you want to participate, you can fill in the form at the end




----------------------->Why this study?<--------------------

-->https://i.postimg.cc/JzVsqx6y/shutterstock-121014031-2.png

-->We would like to know which symptoms you experience and how much you suffer from them. We also would like to know how you feel about school, friends and family.


--> Most information about how teenagers with sickle cell disease their daily life is affected comes from the US. But teenagers living in Europe have different experiences, and it’s even different between countries. It is important to learn about these differences because when new treatments become available, we can find out faster if it also improves the lives of patients in Europe. 

-->Patients with sickle cell disease experience many physical and emotional complaints daily. The way that the disease impacts their life is not the same for every patient. There are also differences in how patients experience the disease, depending on which country they live in and on their living circumstances. Most studies about the burden of SCD have been performed in the US and these are not always representative of how patients living in Europe experience their disease. It is important to have more knowledge about how the disease affects patients in Europe, so that when new treatments become available, we can find out much quicker if it improves the quality of life of patients in Europe

Survey:
1.Survey F36 & Measurement
The Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) was a 2-year observational study of patients with chronic conditions, conducted in a cross-sectional phase among 22,462 patients and in a longitudinal phase among 2349 patients (Tarlov et al. 1989). 

https://i.postimg.cc/VNZz7rrj/Rectangle-3-1.png

2. Diary + check
The content validation testing included 18 in-depth hybrid concept elicitation and cognitive debriefing interviews conducted with SCD patients in the US aged 12 years and older. Interviewers used a semi-structured interview guide and a think-aloud approach for the cognitive debriefing portion. All interviews were recorded, transcribed, coded and analyzed.


https://i.postimg.cc/BbYHr7Bs/important-steps.jpg

3. Diary
Eighteen interviews across two rounds were conducted. Round 1 hybrid interviews (n = 12) resulted in the expansion of the SCPD-S from 13 to 19 items. Items on the impact of an SCPC on social and recreational activities, sleep, and emotional well-being were added. Five items were significantly revised, as were three response choice sets.
