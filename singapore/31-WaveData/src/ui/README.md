## WaveData
WaveData connects people who want to help with medical researchers who need data. The biggest difference with existing platforms is that we approach the problem fromt the side of the people who want to help cure a disease. WaveData has 2 roles: Organizer and users/patients.

With the WaveData marketplace the organizer can create their studys and surveys and set the questions, rewards etc. With the WaveData app, peoople can download a user-friendly app to survey and join studys.

WaveData helps each user and organizer to keep touch everyday. On WaveData the organizer can check how many people have contributed and what their answers are. WaveData provides chart analysis options for the organizer to keep updated with better understanding.

For wavedata, we are using Tron to store user's details, study details, Rewards details (for each Study), Survey, Audiences, Contributors and retirieving those in our website.
