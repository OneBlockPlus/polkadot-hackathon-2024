# WebGLChannel Class

The WebGLChannel class is a MonoBehaviour that facilitates communication between Unity and React in a WebGL context.

## Key Features:

- Implements DontDestroyOnLoad to persist across scene changes
- Provides methods for bidirectional communication between Unity and React
- Uses JSON serialization for data exchange

## Important Methods:

### WaitReactCallMe(string message)

This method is called by React to send messages to Unity. It deserializes the incoming JSON message into a SigmaUnityChannelProto object and processes it.

### CallReactJS(string _msg)

A static method that sends messages from Unity to React. It's conditionally compiled for WebGL builds and uses the CallReactFunction2 method to communicate with React.

## External Method:

`[DllImport("__Internal")]
private static extern void CallReactFunction2(string message);`
This external method is used to call JavaScript functions from Unity in WebGL builds.

# SigmaUnityChannelProto Class

The SigmaUnityChannelProto class is a serializable class that defines the structure for messages exchanged between Unity and React.

## Properties:

- Act: A string representing the action or message type
- Req: A Dictionary<string, object> for storing request data
- Resp: A string for storing response data

## Methods:

### EncodeJson()

Serializes the SigmaUnityChannelProto object into a JSON string. It creates a new dictionary with 'act' and 'req' fields, where 'req' is serialized separately.

### DecodcJson()

Deserializes the Resp string based on the Act property. It handles different message types:

- "`wallet_info`": Deserializes into a WalletStream object and updates ChainsData
- "`all_my_cybors`": Deserializes into a Dictionary<long, CyborNFTStream> and updates ChainsData
Returns the deserialized object or null for unhandled message types.

## Note:

The code includes TODO comments for encrypting the Req property and decrypting the Resp property, which should be implemented for secure communication.
