# DOTfi

 **Project Name**: DOTfi
    
 **Project Creation Date**: September 13, 2024
    
**Project Background**:
DOTfi is a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform built on the Polkadot network using Substrate, Frontier's EVM pallet. The project's primary goal is to **bring broader DeFi capabilities from other ecosystems into the Polkadot ecosystem**, enhancing interoperability and expanding the range of financial services available to users on Polkadot. By integrating assets like Bitcoin (BTC) and USDT, DOTfi enables functionalities such as swapping, lending, and borrowing, thereby bridging the gap between isolated blockchain ecosystems and fostering a more connected DeFi landscape.

**Problem the Project Tries to Resolve**:
The DeFi landscape is often fragmented, with different ecosystems offering unique financial services that are not readily accessible across chains. This fragmentation limits users' ability to fully leverage their assets and participate in a wide range of DeFi activities. DOTfi aims to resolve this issue by bringing broader DeFi capabilities from other ecosystems into the Polkadot network. By enabling cross-chain interoperability and integrating non-native assets, DOTfi expands the financial services available on Polkadot, allowing users to engage in diverse DeFi functionalities such as swapping, lending, and borrowing, all within a single, interconnected platform.

## Features Planned for the Hackathon

**Status Before Participating in the Hackathon**:
    
Before the Hackathon, DOTfi was in the conceptual phase. Key components, including the bridge pallet for BTC peg-in and the swap pallet for asset exchanges, were thought of, but not implemented.
    
**Features Planned for the Hackathon**:
    
**Bridge Implementation**: Develop a bridge contract to enable users to bridge assets like BTC and USDT, bringing them into the Polkadot ecosystem.
        
**Swap Development**: Create a swap contract using an Automated Market Maker (AMM) model to allow users to exchange assets seamlessly.
        
**Lending and Borrowing Contract**: Implement a lending module where users can deposit assets as collateral to borrow other assets, with collateral management and liquidation features.
        
**Frontend Integration**: Build a user-friendly frontend application to interact with the blockchain, including functionalities for depositing assets, swapping, and managing loans.

## Track and Bounty

**Track Chosen**: Category 3: (Chain ) Building a blockchain based on Polkadot SDK

***Note:** 
Even though project fits in DeFi track as well, it is much broader form implementation perspective*
