# Murmur 

See the [README](../README.md).

## Repositories 

We have opted to use external repos rather than adding the code directly to the hackathon submission repo. Apart from some items in the [pallets](https://github.com/ideal-lab5/pallets) repo, all work completed was done as part of this hackathon.

- [murmur - Polkadot Hackathon 2024](https://github.com/ideal-lab5/murmur/tree/polkadot-hackathon-2024)
    - We did an initial PoC of this idea ~6 months ago, but with very limited functionality and no testing. This is encapsulated in the first *two* commits to the repo made last March. The code prior to the hackathon consisted of building of OTP codes and MMRs, but with no great functionality, structure, or optimizations. Reviewers can inspect the repo state pre-hackathon participation by inspecting the history here: https://github.com/ideal-lab5/murmur/commits/polkadot-hackathon-2024/?after=49f9d1e97c2d1b40dd88295c8cf4231cb408a2f3+69. Only work completed after commit hash 9444bb070caff547b518cfc5decc7aa43ee06d72 should be considered for judging.
