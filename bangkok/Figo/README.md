### Figo - NFC-Powered Phygital NFTs for Interactive Gaming on Moonbeam.

### Introducing Figo

---

Figo is a web application-based decentralized app (DApp) designed to revolutionize the world of collectibles by seamlessly blending physical and digital experiences through NFC technology. Each collectible figure, embedded with an NTAG215 NFC chip, allows users to effortlessly connect to their Web3.0 wallets on the Moonbeam network, creating a contract wallet via Account Abstraction and minting unique, Equippable NFTs. These NFTs serve as in-game assets, enabling players to equip and unequip gears NFTs onto the collectibles, enhancing gameplay and interactions. Figo bridges the physical and digital realms, offering a dynamic phygital experience where ownership, gaming, and creativity converge in a single, innovative platform.

### Why Figo ?

Traditionally, collectible figures are primarily physical, and while they offer aesthetic or sentimental value, their utility remains limited to being displayed or stored in personal collections. The traditional way of collectible figures means that users cannot engage with them in digital spaces, missing out on additional value and interactive experiences. Moreover, managing both physical and digital collections can be cumbersome and disjointed, leading to fragmented ownership and lacking of streamlined utility.

1. **Limited Interactions and Utility:**
    - Physical collectible figures are often restricted to passive use, such as being displayed on a shelf or stored away, offering no engagement beyond their presence. Collectors are unable to interact with their figures in meaningful ways, and the collectible’s value remains largely static.
2. **Lack of Digital Ownership Integration:**
    - Traditional collectible figures do not leverage digital ownership, meaning collectors cannot verify, transfer, or monetize them within the growing world of digital assets. Without a digital counterpart, these collectible figures are left out of the broader ecosystem of blockchain-based ownership and trading.
3. **Fragmented Collection Management:**
    - Managing physical and digital collections separately can be inefficient and cumbersome, requiring collectors to navigate different platforms and systems. Collectors often lack a streamline way to view, manage, or interact with their collectible figures, resulting in a disjointed experience.
4. **Limited Value of Collecting:**
    - While collecting physical collectible figures can be rewarding, their inherent value is often limited based on rarity or sentimental attachment. Without digital utility or interactive elements, traditional collectible figures miss opportunities for value appreciation and engagement beyond initial acquisition.

**In summary, traditional physical collectible figures offer limited engagement, disconnected ownership experiences, and fragmented management, leaving collectors with physical figures that lack utility in the digital world.** Figo solves these issues by integrating NFC-enabled figures with Web3.0 wallets, allowing users to seamlessly manage their collection figures, enhance their value through interactive NFTs, and enjoy a unified physical and digital collecting experience.

### Figo - The Ideal Solution!

Figo addresses the limitations of traditional collectible figures by combining NFC-tag technology, blockchain, and gaming to create an interactive and dynamic collecting experience. Here's how Figo solves these key challenges:

- **Seamless Wallet Creation and NFT Minting:** Figo uses NFC-tag technology to easily trigger the creation of a smart contract wallet when a collectible figure is scanned. This automatically mints the physical figure into a digital Equippable NFT, simplifying ownership and making it accessible to all users.
- **Dynamic Equippable NFTs:** Users can customize their NFTs by purchasing gears (child NFTs) with in-game rewards and equipping or unequipping them onto their parent NFTs (collectible figure). This feature turns static collectibles into dynamic, interactive digital assets that enhance gameplay and utility.
- **No Gas Fees for Users:** With Figo’s treasury (bundlers), users don’t have to worry about gas fees, as they are covered automatically by Figo. This creates a smooth, hassle-free experience for both new and experienced users without needing to hold native tokens for gas fees.
- **Gamified Interaction and Rewards:** Figo includes a control panel where users can test their NFTs in a game-like environment, earn rewards, and use those rewards to upgrade their digital collectibles. This adds value and engagement to the overall experience.

Figo transforms the world of collectible figures by bridging both physical and digital worlds, offering dynamic customization options and providing a smooth, gas-free experience for users.

### Key Features of Figo

### Seamless onboarding experience with NFC-Tag

Figo offers a streamlined onboarding experience through NFC-tag technology, making it easy for users to create a **ERC-4337 Standard smart contract wallet** by simply scanning their phygital assets. Each phygital asset is uniquely minted and stored within its wallet, enhancing its value by allowing ownership and authenticity to be securely established on the Moonbeam. This creates a monetizing opportunity, as users can resell their phygital assets, transferring both the physical item and its associated digital identity. If a user wants to swap their NFTs, Figo offers a straightforward solution—simply log out and scan the new phygital asset to instantly access the corresponding wallet.

### Interact with your ERC-6220 Equippable NFTs RMRK Standard

Figo utilizes ERC-6220 equippable NFTs based on the RMRK standard, offering users the ability to mint parent NFTs and enhance them with child NFTs—referred to as gears—that can be equipped and unequipped dynamically. Through the use of NFC-tag phygital collectible figures, each figure becomes a key to unlock and interact with this functionality. Once a collectible figure is scanned, it creates a smart contract wallet, storing the minted NFT and linking it with the user’s unique digital identity. Users can further enrich their collectible by purchasing gears, which function as child NFTs, and seamlessly equipping or unequipping them onto the parent figure.

This integration allows for a highly customizable and interactive experience where users can personalize their digital collectibles within the Figo ecosystem. The entire process is streamlined through the NFC tag, giving the user a tangible, physical key to a digital world.

### Treasury Gas Fees covering on behalf of users in Figo

Figo enhances the user experience by incorporating a treasury system, known as bundlers, that covers gas fees on behalf of the user. This means that every interaction with NFTs—whether it's minting, equipping, unequipping, or purchasing new child NFTs—can be done without worrying about the typical transaction costs associated with blockchain operations. By handling gas fees internally, Figo makes the platform accessible to users of all backgrounds, even those unfamiliar with cryptocurrency management, creating a seamless experience for interacting with phygital assets. The treasury not only ensures that users can fully engage with the platform without financial barriers, but it also enables continuous interaction with their digital collectibles. Whether users are customizing their NFTs or exploring the control panel to test new gears, the bundlers system ensures a gas-free, hassle-free process that encourages more frequent participation. This creates a more engaging and rewarding environment, allowing users to focus on the enjoyment and functionality of their assets while Figo takes care of the complexities in the background.
