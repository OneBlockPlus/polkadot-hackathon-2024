# Monetizado
## Introduction

Monetizado is an on-chain pay-per-view platform that allows you to monetize any web page and static content (if you don't have access to the backend to make changes) through Web3.

With Monetizado, you can implement it on news sites, social networks, exclusive content portals, and more. You could also use it to incentivize users to pay not to see advertising on your sites.

### Features
Monetizado allows you to:
- Specify protected content with a specific amount that users must pay to access.
- Review the protected content you have created.
- To your followers/users, pay to see your content.
- Check if a user has access to your content.
- Change the cost of access to content if required.
- Unprotect the content (if you want to release it to everyone for some time).
- Withdraw the money collected for your content.

### Use case
You can use monetized to protect pages so that only subscribers can see it, as in:
- News portals.
- Videos.
- Audios.
- Files
- Blogs.
- Social networks.
- And much more.
