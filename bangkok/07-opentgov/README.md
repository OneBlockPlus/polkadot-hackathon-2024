## Introduction

[OpenTGov](https://opentgov.com) is a new Telegram platform built for voting & participating in Polkadot's OpenGov.

It aims at improving participation, transparency and discussion of DOT stakeholders regarding on-chain referendums.

More than only discovering new spending proposals or tracking them, DOT stakeholders will be able to directly vote in telegram using the bot, in a trustless-way thanks to the governance proxy.

It empowers users to participate in on-chain governance, vote on referenda, and stay informed about the latest proposals.
