# PixelChain - Bangkok Hackathon 2024


Roar Network is an incentivized Layer 1 blockchain built using the Polkadot SDK, serving as a multichain hub for Polkadot with a Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. It incorporates Dapp Staking and Randomization to enhance security. Roar supports a custom Cross-Virtual Machine that is currently compatible with EVM and soon with WASM, enabling bi-directional calls between WASM and EVM regardless of the programming language used in the contracts.

Roar's primary goal is to enable the development of diverse, sustainable cross-chain applications by extending Polkadot's XCM capabilities, allowing cross-chain messaging between any EVM-compatible blockchain, including those outside the Dotsama ecosystem. The platform offers built-in incentives and rewards to developers based on the value and impact of their dApps, rather than their network connections or access to capital.

Unlike traditional smart contract platforms, where token distribution is often concentrated among early participants, Roar is designed to ensure fair distribution across all contributors, users, and stakeholders.
