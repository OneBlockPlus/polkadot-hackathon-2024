## Technical Architecture

Using Javacard 3.0.4 to build firmware for secure element, and implement the ED25519 and SLIP-0010 on it. 

The desktop wallet app communicates with the Javacard applets via smartcard reader, using ISO-7816 standard.
The mobile wallet app communicates with the Javacard applets via NFC, using ISO-14443 standard.

Tech stack used,
- Golang Wails framework
- React and React Native
