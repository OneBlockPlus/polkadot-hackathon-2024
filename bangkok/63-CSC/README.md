## Basic Info

Project Name: CSC(Credit Score Chain)

## Project Details

### Introduction
CSC is a blockchain-based credit scoring system that aims to provide a fair and transparent credit scoring system for consumers. It is a decentralized application that uses customized runtime pallet to verify the creditworthiness of consumers based on their proofs and other relevant information.

### Background
The balance and points recharge in the service industry are generally hard to guarantee value. For example, after some beauty salons or gyms collect annual fees from customers, due to various reasons, when customers revisit after a long time, they find that the business has changed completely. The points in the customers' hands are no longer recognized by the new business, which believes that the points have nothing to do with them. Customers can only choose to give up the points or resort to legal action, leading to unfairness and lack of transparency in the service industry.


### Insights
It is designed to be a public good that can be used by anyone, anywhere, and at any time.

The most important thing is the transfer of Scores value with 0 gas fees.

### Architecture
CSC is designed to be run by multiple parties, including Credit, Score, Publishers, and Users. It is designed to be mutilated by functions such as publish_score, redeem_era, score_grant, inspire_score, claim_score, ranking_list, transfer score between users, and more.
