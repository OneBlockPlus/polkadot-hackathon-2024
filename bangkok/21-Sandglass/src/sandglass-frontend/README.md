Sandglass is a decentralized privacy-preserving token mixer built on the Polkadot/Substrate ecosystem. It leverages zero-knowledge proofs (zk-SNARKs) to anonymize token transfers, ensuring both strong privacy and legal compliance by integrating access control mechanisms like whitelisting and digital identity verification. In addition to its primary function as a mixer, Sandglass allows users to directly swap tokens within the platform, offering a unique blend of privacy and utility.

## Getting started ðŸš€

### 1. Run the frontend

The frontend works out of the box, without a local node running.

> **Pre-requisites:**
>
> - Setup Node.js v18+ (recommended via [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) with `nvm install 18`)
> - Install [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) (recommended via [Node.js Corepack](https://nodejs.org/api/corepack.html) or `npm i -g pnpm`)
> - Clone this repository

<details>
<summary><strong>Special Instructions for Windows Users</strong></summary>

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Windows users must either use [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/wsl/install) (recommended) or a custom shell like [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads). PowerShell is not supported.

> **Pre-requisites when using WSL for Linux:**
>
> - Install [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/wsl/install) and execute _all_ commands in the WSL terminal
> - Setup Node.js v18+ (recommended via [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) with `nvm install 18`)
> - Install the following npm packages globally:
> - `npm i -g npm`
> - `npm i -g pnpm node-gyp make`
> - Clone this repository into the WSL file system (e.g. `/home/<user>/inkathon`).
>
> **Tip:** You can enter `\\wsl$\` in the top bar of the Windows Explorer to access the WSL file system visually.
