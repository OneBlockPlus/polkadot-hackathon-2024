# No Sandwich Swap

## Introduction

**No Sandwich Swap** is an anti-MEV DEX that utilizes **Hyperbolic Call Auction (HCA)** to aggregate multiple trades over a period of time. By subdividing them infinitely and staggering them evenly, it helps to amortize the price shock effect of a single trade, while spreading out the trades of MEV attackers over the entire cycle. This effectively reduces arbitrage gains for MEV attackers.

### Key Benefits:

1. **For the Market**: Reduces price shocks, allowing the actual transaction price to be closer to the fair price.
2. **For Attackers**: Effectively protects against MEV attacks, making sandwich attacks unprofitable.
3. **For Traders**: Enhances user experience by reducing slippage encountered by regular traders.
4. **For Liquidity Providers (LPs)**: Reduces price volatility and minimizes LPs' exposure to impermanent losses.
5. **For the Ecosystem**: Encourages more trades and increases market liquidity through governance token incentives.

## Features Planned for the Hackathon

### Current Status Before Hackathon:
- Derived a brand-new Anti-MEV AMM theory through mathematical proof.

### Features Planned for Hackathon:
- Implemented the mathematical theory and designed tokenomics based on this theory.

## Architecture

### System Architecture Diagram:
We have developed No Sandwich Swap, an MEV-resistant DEX that uses a Hyperbolic Call Auction (HCA) mechanism. This mechanism aggregates multiple transactions over a certain period and then infinitely subdivides and uniformly interleaves them, thereby smoothing out the price impact of individual transactions and dispersing the trades of MEV attackers throughout the entire cycle, significantly reducing their arbitrage profits. Based on this approach, we have proven that the upper bound of asset price volatility within each phase is O(n^1/2), where n is the absolute value of the difference between the amounts of funds sold and bought over a certain period. Our protocol operates on an order placement and settlement model, collecting orders over a certain period before entering the settlement phase, which repeats cyclically.
