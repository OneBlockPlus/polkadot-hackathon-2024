# No Sandwich Swap

## Introduction

**No Sandwich Swap** is an anti-MEV DEX that utilizes **Hyperbolic Call Auction (HCA)** to aggregate multiple trades over a period of time. By subdividing them infinitely and staggering them evenly, it helps to amortize the price shock effect of a single trade, while spreading out the trades of MEV attackers over the entire cycle. This effectively reduces arbitrage gains for MEV attackers.

### Key Benefits:

1. **For the Market**: Reduces price shocks, allowing the actual transaction price to be closer to the fair price.
2. **For Attackers**: Effectively protects against MEV attacks, making sandwich attacks unprofitable.
3. **For Traders**: Enhances user experience by reducing slippage encountered by regular traders.
4. **For Liquidity Providers (LPs)**: Reduces price volatility and minimizes LPs' exposure to impermanent losses.
5. **For the Ecosystem**: Encourages more trades and increases market liquidity through governance token incentives.
