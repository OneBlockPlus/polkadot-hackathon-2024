## Introduction
Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) has become a significant issue in blockchain networks, particularly within decentralized finance (DeFi). MEV involves the extraction of value from users by reordering, inserting, or canceling transactions in a blockchain network. It is essential to solve this issue to ensure the security and fairness of blockchain consensus.

## How It Works (Mathematical Proof)

**Problem to be Solved (MEV Explained)**

MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) refers to the maximum value that can be extracted from users in a blockchain network by manipulating the order of transactions. It involves:
- **Reordering**
- **Inserting**
- **Canceling transactions**

This often happens in the context of:
- Arbitrage opportunities
- Liquidation operations
- Other priority handling of transactions

Originally discussed in the Ethereum network, MEV also affects other blockchain platforms supporting smart contracts. Traders exploit DeFi smart contracts to extract value, often undermining blockchain consensus security.

### Example of MEV: Sandwich Attack
Miners or validators observe unconfirmed transactions in the mempool and perform front-running to profit by:
1. Buying assets before the target transaction
2. Selling assets after the target transaction completes at a higher price

Such attacks harm regular users by:
- Depriving profits
- Manipulating asset prices

Between 2018 and 2020, MEV generated **$5.4M** in profit, with sandwich attacks alone contributing **$1.73M**.

## Existing Solutions

### Flashbots
An open-source project to mitigate the negative impacts of MEV by:
- Establishing an independent auction system
- Handling transactions outside of the public memory pool (mempool)
- Preventing front-running by offering "private transactions"

### MEV-Boost
This solution allows nodes to:
- Obtain blocks from block relays
- Build blocks automatically or retrieve them from professional block builders
- Redistribute MEV-related profits

However, both approaches struggle to completely prevent the asset value fluctuations caused by MEV.

## Introducing No Sandwich Swap

We developed **No Sandwich Swap**, an MEV-resistant DEX. It uses a **hyperbolic batch auction mechanism** that:
- Aggregates multiple transactions over time
- Infinitely subdivides and interleaves them, reducing price impact
- Disperses trades of MEV attackers throughout the cycle

### Mathematical Proof
The upper bound of asset price volatility within each phase is proven to be **O(n^1/2)**, where:
- **n** is the absolute difference between the sold and bought funds over a certain period.

This protocol operates cyclically:
1. Collect orders over a period
2. Enter a settlement phase that repeats periodically

## Key Features (五个核心价值)

1. **For the Market**:  
   Reduce price impact, aligning the transaction price closer to the fair price.
2. **For Attackers**:  
   Effectively prevent MEV attacks and make sandwich attacks unprofitable.
3. **For Traders**:  
   Reduce slippage significantly, improving user experience.
4. **For Liquidity Providers (LPs)**:  
   Mitigate price volatility, reducing impermanent loss.
5. **For the Ecosystem**:  
   Increase trading incentives through governance tokens, enhancing liquidity.
