# 24X Chain: 24/7 Decentralized Derivatives Trading Platform

## Introduction 

**Project Name:** 24X  
**Created:** September 30, 2024  
**Origin:** Polkadot Bangkok Hackathon 2024 Project

### The Problem & Solution
Traditional derivative markets are restricted by trading hours, geographical boundaries, and centralized control. 24X leverages Polkadot's infrastructure to create a truly 24/7, borderless, and decentralized derivatives trading platform. Our solution enables users to trade synthetic versions of any asset (stocks, forex, commodities) at any time, from anywhere, without relying on centralized intermediaries.

## Hackathon Development Status

### Pre-Hackathon Status
- Initial concept and ideation phase

### Planned Hackathon Deliverables

âœ… Completed:
- Parachain implementation on Polkadot
- Core pallets for synthetic derivatives creation
- User interface for asset creation and transfers

ðŸš§ In Progress:
- Trading functionality pallets

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Synthetic Token Pallet**
   - Creates and manages synthetic assets
   - Handles token minting and burning
   - Manages token parameters and metadata

2. **Pools Pallet**
   - Enables permissionless pool creation
   - Manages liquidity provision
   - Handles pool parameters and trading pairs

3. **Reserves Pallet**
   - Manages user deposits and collateral
   - Handles reserve requirements for synthetic tokens
   - Processes withdrawals and reserve adjustments

4. **Risk Management System**
   - Real-time position monitoring
   - Automated risk assessment
   - Liquidation mechanism implementation
   - System health indicators
