# Node

ℹ️ A node -  in Polkadot - is a binary executable, whose primary purpose is to execute the [runtime](../runtime/README.md).

🔗 It communicates with other nodes in the network, and aims for
[consensus](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-consensus) among them.

⚙️ It can act as a remote procedure call (RPC) server, allowing interaction with the blockchain.
