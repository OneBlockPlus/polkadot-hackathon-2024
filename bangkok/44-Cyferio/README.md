# Cyferio Hub

## Introduction

Cyferio Hub is a decentralized cryptographic collaborative caching layer based on Substrate. It aims to build a modular network stack on critical infrastructure to enhance the experience of billions of users and promote the realization of a decentralized Internet.

Cyferio Hub provides an AVS (Autonomous Validation System) ecosystem for the TMC (Trustless Modular Calculator), an AVS consumer bearer server-side framework. This helps projects provide end-to-end capabilities and expand their realization. Regardless of the tier of Vertical SaaS, projects can connect to Cyferio Hub as a caching relay tier for an improved user experience.

### Key Components

1. **TMC (Trustless Modular Calculator)**: A modular co-processor and rollup stack enabling verifiable Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE). It unlocks privacy-preserving, massively parallel execution of computations for both Web2 and Web3 applications.

2. **Float Cache DB**: Based on DragonflyDB's modern architectural cache database and Jellyfish Merkle Tree (JMT) implementation from Diem. Our self-developed Float Cache DB unlocks powerful distributed caching capabilities, bringing significant improvements to network load and user experience.

- [x] TMC Relay Message Cluster Integration with Walrus Storage

## Schedule

We had only 7 days between signing up for the contest and completing the code. Our focus was on delivering an MVP version that covers:

1. Planned features
2. Demo video
3. Presentation
