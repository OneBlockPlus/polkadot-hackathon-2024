## Install

Demeter is available on pypi, so it's esay to install: 

```bash
pip install zelos-demeter
```

The version there would not be updated frequently, so if you want to get latest version, you can clone the git repo and import locally.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zelos-alpha/demeter.git
```

## Versions

For now, demeter have two main branch: 

* Versions above 0.3.x: latest version, support uniswap market and aave market. It's a major update, so there is some breaking change. 
* Ver 0.2.x: older version, support uniswap market only. If you mind those breaking change, you can stay in this branch

0.2.x version will only have bug-fixing. If you insist on staying in version 0.2.x, you can check out v0.2 branch or the latest tag on v0.2.
