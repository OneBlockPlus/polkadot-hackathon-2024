### Project Name

**Karting-Hero**

### Project Background

Karting-Hero is a web3-based 3D kart racing game developed by Marbles Studio, an indie game studio co-founded by Saleh Joe and MR Salman. The team members have extensive experience in game development and blockchain technology.

### Problem to be Solved

Traditional multiplayer games often lack transparent reward distribution mechanisms, and players have limited control over in-game assets. Karting-Hero leverages blockchain technology to ensure fair reward distribution and true ownership of game assets. Players can trust that their earnings and assets are secure and verifiable on the blockchain.

### Project Overview

Karting-Hero is a multiplayer 3D kart racing game where players compete on various tracks at high speed. Each match involves four players who pay a certain amount of tokens as an entry fee, forming a prize pool. At the end of the race, the prize pool is distributed to the winner. The game offers customizable karts, cool skins, and power-ups, adding strategy and excitement to the gameplay. The winner receives the majority of the prize pool, while a small portion remains in the smart contract to incentivize continued gameplay.

### Technical Architecture

- **Game Engine:** Unity 3D
- **Multiplayer Backend:** Colyseus
- **Blockchain Integration:** ink! smart contracts on Polkadot
- **Smart Contract Functions:** Store race results, rankings, and distribute rewards
- **Frontend:** WebGL-based web interface for rendering the Unity game

### Team Information
