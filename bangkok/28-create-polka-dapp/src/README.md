## New CLI Features

We've added new utility features to the CLI to enhance your Polkadot dApp development experience:

1. **Contract Development Tools**: Easily scaffold and manage your smart contracts.
2. **Network Configuration**: Streamlined setup for connecting to different Polkadot networks.
3. **Testing Utilities**: Integrated tools for unit and integration testing of your dApp.
4. **New Frontend Frameworks**: Added new frontend frameworks to the templates.
5. **Removed Support for JS frontend templates**: Decided to keep only TS templates as developers should use Typescript when interacting with the polkadot api library.

## Future Additions

Here are some exciting features on `create-polka-dapp` roadmap:

1. **Standalone Contract Development Library**: We're extracting our contract development utility to create a tool on its own making it a separate library for more flexibility and easier maintenance.

2. **Modular Wallet Connection Component**: The wallet connection functionality will be available as a standalone, customizable component library, so developers can decide to use the component if they

3. **Enhanced CLI Capabilities**: More commands and options to further streamline your development workflow.

4. **Additional Framework Support**: We're planning to add support for more frontend frameworks and build tools.
