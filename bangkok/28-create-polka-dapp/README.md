### Project Background

- [Repo](https://github.com/OpeOginni/create-polka-dapp/tree/polkadot-2024-hackathon)
- Participated in the Polkadot Prodigy Hackathon where the project was initiated.
- Have received no extra funding or grants.

### Introduction

**Create Polka Dapp** is a scaffolding CLI tool aimed at developers looking to quickly set up their Polkadot-based dApp. It currently focuses on frontend-only development but has a roadmap for expansion. The key features include:

### Problem Statement

Polkadot offers a highly scalable, interoperable network for building decentralized applications, but many developers face the challenge of getting started with setting up projects. To solve this, **Create Polka Dapp** provides an easy-to-use CLI for scaffolding starter applications, simplifying the development process for Polkadot-based dApps.

Despite its initial utility, the project currently supports only frontend creation, and thereâ€™s a strong need for more flexibility in terms of frameworks, contracts, and evm and substrate chains.

The complexities with wallets in the Polkadot ecosystem also makes many developers to rush to ship out only custodial wallet systems for their users, this makes some builders shy away from developing on polkadot.

Create-Polka-Dapp solves this by providing simplified and customizable templates in different frontend frameworks that assist developers with setting up the wallet flow on their dapps, and now we also support contract side development providing users with ways to deploy and interact with their contracts, using simple scripts, with Javascript.

The project's main code repository is available [here](https://github.com/OpeOginni/create-polka-dapp/tree/polkadot-2024-hackathon), and the NPM package can be found [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-polka-dapp).

## Things Planned to be Done During the Hackathon

- Runtime Module
  - [x] Scaffold contracts for different parachains.
  - [x] Integrate contract templates alongside frontend templates.
- Web Frontend
  - [x] Add Next.js as a frontend option.
  - [x] Improve existing React and Svelte templates with modern best practices.
- CLI Templates
  - [x] Scaffold options for contracts, frontend-only, or full-stack depending on developer needs.
  - [ ] Custom CLI templates for specific parachains based on development tools (EVM or INK)
- Contract LifeCycle Process Support (Mentorship Meetup advice)
  - [x] Provide developers who decide to generate contracts with simple tools (utilities) to perfom tasks like deploy and interact with their contracts. Though the Command Line or Through easy to write scripts.. Just like Hardhat for the Eth ecosystem

## Hackathon Progress

As the project develops during the hackathon, this section will track the completed features and milestones.

- 2024 Hackathon Milestone:
  - Added new CLI templates.
  - Enhanced wallet functionality and flow.
  - Initial contract scaffolding support.

### Commit Progress

- [Updated CLI dependencies (moved to more lightweight deps) & Setup templates into categories (frontend, contract, frontend + contract)](https://github.com/OpeOginni/create-polka-dapp/commit/13d0a79bab110845b73aec3310b9bb8c80ccf43a)

  - Reduced the size of the package by getting rid of JS frontend templates as developers can easily switch the TS templates to work as JS.
  - Completely updated the React + TS frontend template, adding tailwindcss for styling and improving the wallet connection UI and UX.
  - Lastly I decided to stick with `Polkadot-Onboard` for the wallet connection and interaction as this provides end developers with a smooth use and they can make their own custom changes as easy as they like.

## Post Hackathon Features

These are some extra features I would like to continue to work on, based on advice given from workshops and mentor sessions

1. **Standalone Contract Development Library**: We're extracting our contract development utility to create a tool on its own making it a separate library for more flexibility and easier maintenance.

2. **Modular Wallet Connection Component**: The wallet connection functionality will be available as a standalone, customizable component library, so developers can decide to use the component if they

3. **Enhanced CLI Capabilities**: More commands and options to further streamline your development workflow.

4. **Additional Framework Support**: We're planning to add support for more frontend frameworks and build tools.
