### Problem Statement

Polkadot offers a highly scalable, interoperable network for building decentralized applications, but many developers face the challenge of getting started with setting up projects. To solve this, **Create Polka Dapp** provides an easy-to-use CLI for scaffolding starter applications, simplifying the development process for Polkadot-based dApps.

Despite its initial utility, the project currently supports only frontend creation, and there’s a strong need for more flexibility in terms of frameworks, contracts, and evm and substrate chains.

### Introduction

**Create Polka Dapp** is a scaffolding CLI tool aimed at developers looking to quickly set up their Polkadot-based dApp. It currently focuses on frontend-only development but has a roadmap for expansion. The key features include:

- **Frontend Scaffolding**: Quickly set up React or Svelte-based frontends for Polkadot applications.
- **Wallet Integration**: Out-of-the-box wallet connection functionality for Polkadot.
- **Future Expansion**: Plans to support contracts, full-stack setups, and integration with various parachains.

The project's main code repository is available [here](https://github.com/OpeOginni/create-polka-dapp/tree/polkadot-2024-hackathon), and the NPM package can be found [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-polka-dapp).
