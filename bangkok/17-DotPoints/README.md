# DotPoints
## Introduction
DotPoins is a chain built for taking loyalty programs to the next level. It creates a unified ecosystem for loyalty points by leveraging Polkadot's multichain messaging, thereby generating a liquid economy. The platform is targeted at companies seeking to generate revenue through their loyalty programs. To achieve this, DotPoints introduces a staking and liquidity pool (LP)-like mechanism as a core part of its tokenomics.
