  "default": "These Terms of Use (“Agreement”) set forth the general terms and conditions of your use of the SubWallet extension application, mobile application, and web dashboard application (\"SubWallet Application\") and any of its related products and services (collectively, “Services”). \n\nThis Agreement is legally binding between you (“User”, “you” or “your”) and this application developer (“Operator”, “we”, “us” or “our”). If you are entering into this Agreement on behalf of a business or other legal entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind such an entity to this Agreement, in which case the terms “User”, “you” or “your” shall refer to such entity. \n\nIf you do not have such authority, or if you do not agree with the terms of this Agreement, you must not accept this Agreement and may not access and use the SubWallet Application and Services. By accessing and using the SubWallet Application and Services, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement. You acknowledge that this Agreement is a contract between you and the Operator, even though it is electronic and is not physically signed by you, and it governs your use of the SubWallet Application and Services.\n\nThis Agreement is written in various languages. If there is any dispute, the English language shall prevail.\n\n#### **Accounts and membership**\n\nIf you create a wallet in the SubWallet Application, you are responsible for maintaining the security of your wallet and you are fully responsible for all activities that occur with the wallet and any other actions taken in connection with it. You should understand that we do not have access to any wallet-related information on our side, nor are we able to send it to any other party. \n\nAll such information is stored locally on your device(s) which we do not have access to and you bear full responsibility for its (their) safety. Your wallet private keys/seed phrases are not backed up along with other data so if you delete SubWallet Application, it will be impossible to restore your keys from a backup.\n\n#### **Privacy Policy**\n\nWe respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it through our compliance with this privacy policy (“Policy”). This Policy describes the types of information we may collect from you or that you may provide on the SubWallet Application, SubWallet.App website, and any of their related products and services, and our practices for collecting, using, maintaining, protecting, and disclosing that information. By accessing and using the Services, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by the terms of this Policy. This Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that we do not own or control, or to individuals that we do not employ or manage. \n\n##### **Information category**\n\nFor the purposes of the given document, we would like to classify information into the following categories: Data that is used for wallet creation, import, and export (i.e., seed phrase, private key, etc.) (“Sensitive information”), personally identifiable information (i.e., data that could potentially identify you as an individual) (“Personal information”), and Non-personally identifiable information (i.e., information that cannot be used to identify who you are) (“Non-personal information”). This Policy covers all the categories and will tell you how we might collect and use each type.\n\n*Sensitive information*\n\nYour Sensitive information is not collected or stored by us. In particular, it is not sent anywhere, is not stored anywhere except your device, and is not included in backups of the operating system. We are committed to making sure your information is protected and we employ several mechanisms to keep your information safe, including on-device encryption, verification and authentication by password or biometrics, and securing all network connections with industry-standard transport layer security. However, even with these precautions taken by us, the safety of your device and your seed phrase or backup data is solely your responsibility.\n\n*Personal information & Non-personal information*\n\nYou can access and use the Services without telling us who you are or revealing any information by which someone could identify you as a specific, identifiable individual. In other words, no Personal information is collected by our Services. This applies to all categories of users, including children under the age of 18. Please note that our extension and app have been uploaded to the Store on desktop browsers (Chrome, Brave, Edge & Firefox) and mobile (App Store and Play Store). These stores may track some of your information and activities including but not limited to log data, cookies, etc.\n\n##### **Disclosure of information**\n\nWe do not share your information with anyone or for any reason.\n\n##### **Security Measures**\n\nIn the event we become aware that the security of the Services has been compromised as a result of external activity, including, but not limited to, security attacks or fraud, we reserve the right to take reasonably appropriate measures, including, but not limited to, investigation and reporting, as well as notification to and cooperation with law enforcement authorities. In such cases, we will make reasonable efforts to notify affected individuals if we believe that there is a reasonable risk of harm to them or if notice is otherwise required by law. When we do, we will post a notice on the Services.\n\n##### **Do Not Track signals**\n\nSome browsers incorporate a Do Not Track feature that signals to websites you visit that you do not want to have your online activity tracked. Tracking is not the same as using or collecting information in connection with a website. For these purposes, tracking refers to collecting personally identifiable information from consumers who use or visit a website or online service as they move across different websites over time. The Services do not track its visitors over time and across third-party websites. However, some third-party websites may keep track of your browsing activities when they serve you content, which enables them to tailor what they present to you.\n\n#### **Links to other resources**\n\nAlthough the SubWallet Application and Services may link to other resources (such as websites, other applications, etc.), we are not, directly or indirectly, implying any approval, association, sponsorship, endorsement, or affiliation with any linked resource, unless specifically stated herein. We are not responsible for examining or evaluating, and we do not warrant the offerings of any businesses or individuals or the content of their resources. \n\nWe do not assume any responsibility or liability for the actions, products, services, and content of any other third parties. You should carefully review the legal statements and other conditions of use of any resource that you access through a link in the SubWallet Application. Your linking to any other off-site resources is at your own risk.\n\n#### **Prohibited uses**\n\nIn addition to other terms as set forth in the Agreement, you are prohibited from using the SubWallet Application and Services:\n\n1.
