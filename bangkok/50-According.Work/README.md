# Project Overview: According.Work

**According.Work** is a platform for automated and fair reward distribution to open source developers based on their contributions.

# Introduction

- Project Name: [According.Work](https://according-work-beta.netlify.app/projects)
- Creation Date: July 2024
- Problem Being Solved:

Our platform addresses a common issue in the Web3 world: many airdrops are distributed evenly, which is neither fair nor efficient, often requiring extensive manual effort to track contributions. With According.Work, contribution tracking and reward distribution are automated, allowing project owners to allocate rewards with precision, even down to individual commits.

And our ultimate goal is to create an environment where developers are free to unleash their creativity. By leveraging blockchain technology, we aim to make every effort truly worth it.
